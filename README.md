## Challenges We Ran Into
One of the significant hurdles we encountered was our lack of familiarity with Rust, Soroban, and the Stellar blockchain. As these technologies were new to our team, integrating the Web3 backend with our frontend proved to be a challenging task.

Integrating Web3 technology with traditional frontend development required a deep understanding of both blockchain concepts and the specific programming languages and tools involved. This complexity was particularly evident when ensuring secure and efficient communication between the frontend and the blockchain.

To overcome these challenges, our team dedicated a substantial amount of time to learning and mastering Rust, Soroban, and Stellar. We utilized a variety of resources including YouTube videos, documentation, and mentorship.

## Conclusion
WellnessHub makes health management engaging and rewarding by combining Web3 technology with gamified tracking. It motivates users to stay healthy and achieve wellness goals, making it ideal for individuals and organizations alike.
